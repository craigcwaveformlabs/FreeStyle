Origin is FreeAgent’s internal CSS framework.

### What and why

We’re a growing team working across a range of different projects and codebases. Making CSS work at scale is hard. Agreed principles, approaches, and patterns mean we can do better work faster.

Origin gives us a common way of writing CSS. It consumes our [CSS utilities]({{ site.baseurl }}utilities/), provides some plug-and-play [components]({{ site.baseurl }}components/), and also documents our [principles]({{ site.baseurl }}principles/) and HTML and CSS [code styles]({{ site.baseurl }}code-style/). We use it in our desktop app, mobile apps, website, and a bunch of other projects.

### Getting started

Installation instructions can be found [in the Github README](https://github.com/fac/origin/blob/master/README.md#install).

Utilities apply fixed, low-level, structural and positional styles to HTML elements. They almost always only apply one property (e.g. `float: left`) and will generally use `!important` because they're so focussed.

We have our own library of CSS utilities which we share across projects and platforms: [FA CSS Utilities](https://github.com/fac/fa-css-utilities). Refer to the README for usage guidance.

Our `font-size` utility has a standard scale of values ranging from `xx-small` to `xx-large`. These can be applied using our `font-size` Sass mixin, or using `u-font-size--#` utility classes in HTML.

Using the Sass mixin is preferred, as it forces us to consider all objects as [components]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidance/components). Applying utility classes in HTML enforces `!important`, as they're intended to be immutable â€” applying one property and value no matter what.

Rules can optionally be triggered only at certain `@media` breakpoints. There's also a larger numerical scale of values available through the mixin, though these should rarely be needed.


### Examples

Applies default `font-size`

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden DocsExample--render--hidden--grouped">
{% example scss %}
@include font-size(default);
{% endexample %}
</div>

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden">
{% example html %}
<div class="u-font-size--default"></div>
{% endexample %}
</div>


Applies extra large `font-size` at large [breakpoint]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/breakpoint)

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden DocsExample--render--hidden--grouped">
{% example scss %}
@include break(lg) {
  @include font-size(x-large);
}
{% endexample %}
</div>

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden">
{% example html %}
<div class="u-lg-font-size--x-large"></div>
{% endexample %}
</div>


Applies large `font-size` at medium [breakpoint]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/breakpoint)

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden DocsExample--render--hidden--grouped">
{% example scss %}
@include break(md) {
  @include font-size(large);
}
{% endexample %}
</div>

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden">
{% example html %}
<div class="u-md-font-size--large"></div>
{% endexample %}
</div>


Applies small `font-size`, including `!important`

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden DocsExample--render--hidden--grouped">
{% example scss %}
@include break(md) {
  @include font-size(small, !important);
}
{% endexample %}
</div>

<div class="DocsExample DocsExample--render--hidden">
{% example html %}
<div class="u-font-size--small"></div>
{% endexample %}
</div>

## Media queries
`font-size` values can selectively only be applied when certain `min-width` viewport breakpoints are triggered.

This example uses the large `lg` breakpoint, but other options include small `sm`, medium `md`, x-large `x-lg`, and xx-large `xx-lg`.

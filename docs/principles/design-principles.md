      Bring clarity to complexity

        <p>
          Our customers are smart but not experts in finances, so we empower them by bringing clarity to complex issues, not by making things simple. We deal with hard stuff and we’re proud of it.

## Why we have design principles
Our Design Principles guide us in our work, giving us a shared language for objectively evaluating our everyday design decisions. They speak to the individual characteristics of FreeAgent and what makes us different to help us make a truly distinctive product. Principles help us move together as a team, whilst allowing room for individuality.

Most importantly, the team shares a clear understanding of the intent behind our work, which is incredibly empowering.

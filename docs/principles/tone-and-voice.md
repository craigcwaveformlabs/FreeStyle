FreeAgent is straight talking but always approachable.

## The FreeAgent persona

While ready to get down to business, FreeAgent has a mischievous alter-ego where personality, playfulness and even irreverence shine through. This voice is optimised with the FreeAgent Fairy, a sassy personification, that doesn’t take things too seriously.

It’s this voice, that of the little guy, that helps users identify with FreeAgent. At its heart, this should reflect something of the voice of the user, appreciating and seeing things from their perspective.
